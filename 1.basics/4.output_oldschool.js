let stuff = 'some text'; // a string... you can use either single quotes or double quotes

// concatenate a string the old-fasioned way with the + operator
console.log("This is " + stuff + "."); // expected output: 'This is some text.'



//my example:
let hername ="Alecious"
console.log("I love "+ hername + " even though she is can be dramatic sometimes")
